## Hospitals

I had my annual health exam while in Beijing. What would have taken months to schedule and complete in the US, I arranged for the next day through Wechat, selecting around 20 different health metrics to measure. 

The hospital operates like an assembly line. At check-in, they hand you a routing sheet with your first room number at the top, followed by empty numbered lines connected by arrows - a map of your journey through the system. Each room specializes in one type of test: eye exams, blood work, CT scans, heart monitoring… Outside every room, a digital display shows the current patient and waiting list, like a Mcdonald's display showing who’s being served now and whos next..

After each exam, the process runs like clockwork: the doctor enters the results into their system and signs off on your sheet. The software, knowing the wait times and processing speed of each room, calculates your optimal next destination to minimize waiting. The doctor writes this next room number on your sheet, and you move on. No wandering through hallways wondering where to go next, no sitting in crowded waiting rooms hoping to hear your name called.

Two and a half hours later, I had completed every test. I handed in my routing sheet and scanned a QR code to arrange delivery of my comprehensive health report. The entire experience challenged two fundamental assumptions I had about healthcare.

First, hospitals are fundamentally software businesses masquerading as medical facilities. Their efficiency isn't limited by the number of doctors or equipment, but by their ability to process and route patients effectively. Most hospitals I've visited in the US are buried under paperwork and scheduling systems that seem to be decades old. The right software infrastructure could dramatically improve both patient throughput and overall healthcare supply in the economy.

Second, maybe our one-size-fits-all approach to medical training needs rethinking. Not every healthcare provider needs to be a jack of all trades - a path that requires extensive education that drives up costs. Instead, we could adopt more of an assembly line approach: specialists who become extremely proficient at specific tests or procedures through experience, with senior doctors focusing on final diagnoses and complex cases. This specialization, combined with [AI systems that have already shown superior diagnostic accuracy](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-ai-answer-medical-questions-better-than-your-doctor-202403273028) in many areas, could make healthcare dramatically more accessible with better patient experience. 


## Transportation

Beijing’s public transit infrastructure is backed by incredible data and software infrastructure. When you take the subway, monitors display not just arrival times for the next two trains (typically 3-7 minutes apart), but also the capacity of each individual car as a percentage. This simple addition transforms how people use the system. Instead of everyone clustering at the usual entry points, passengers distribute themselves along the platform, optimizing for the least crowded car.

Buses are integrated with the navigation apps. Unlike the often inaccurate arrival times shown on Google Maps, Beijing’s navigation apps show you each bus’s real-time location similar to Uber. It's the difference between hoping a bus might arrive on schedule and knowing exactly when to leave your house.

The high speed rail cruises at 355 km/h, connecting major cities across the country. The trains are spotless and the ride is remarkably smooth - you can barely tell you're moving except for the landscape blurring past your window. Through the rail system's app, passengers can browse restaurants near upcoming stations and order meals for delivery to their seats. The service mimics air travel, with cabin crew walking the aisles taking orders and delivering food, but without the cramped space and stale air of an airplane. Next year's upgrade to 450 km/h will cut the Beijing to Shanghai journey from five hours to three. When you factor in the time spent getting to airports, going through security, checking bags, and traveling from airports back into city centers, the train becomes significantly faster than flying.

## Delivery

Much of Beijing's infrastructure now exists virtually through delivery apps, replacing traditional retail, restaurants, and pharmacies. 

I experienced this at 3 AM one morning with a 103-degree fever. The hospital was closed and I didn't think it warranted an emergency room visit, but through Meituan's pharmacy service, I ordered a flu testing kit. It arrived within 30 minutes at 3:30 AM. When the test came back positive, the medicine I ordered arrived just as quickly. 

While standard online shopping still takes a day or two for delivery, real-time delivery services - similar to what Uber and TaskRabbit attempted in the US - have evolved into something far more robust in China.

There's a clear trade-off: the city's street life has diminished, making neighborhoods feel less vibrant and lively. Yet these delivery apps have made life incredibly convenient, offering services that seem to defy economic logic. This is only possible because of China's approach to the "last mile" delivery problem - throwing armies of low-paid workers at it. These deliverers work long hours and are often seen running to meet their strict delivery deadlines.

The US can't and shouldn't replicate this labor-intensive model. But the benefits of near instant delivery might not be possible without a similar ambitious, heavy handed approach.  It could redesign the infrastructure instead - future buildings could have designated drone corridors and delivery windows built right into their architecture. One can’t build tomorrow’s services on yesterday’s infrastructure. 


## Mental Health Crisis

China is experiencing a shadow mental health pandemic.

At my old school, teachers report a five-fold increase in serious mental health issues. The symptoms are as varied as they are troubling. Some students become randomly violent, unable to regulate their emotions. Some experience such severe anxiety that they walk all the way to school only to freeze at the gates, physically unable to step into the schoolyard. Still others sink into such deep depression that they stop talking, laughing, and learning - eventually requiring hospitalization.

Teachers also note how these problems seem to spread. When students start their first year, typically one child per class shows behavioral issues - already higher than a decade ago when it was one child per 36 classes. By the time they leave, that number jumps to five students per class, with troubled students forming their own groups. Mental health problems, it seems, can be socially contagious.

At the root of this crisis is a fundamental misunderstanding of human development. [Children are being systematically deprived of play](https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/) - that crucial state of discovery where they explore their world, take calculated risks, learn their own resilience, and develop secure attachments with supportive parents. Instead, they're confined to classrooms during all daylight hours, burdened with homework at night, their only relief coming from algorithmically optimized short-form videos designed to hijack their attention. Humans are embodied animals that need real connection to the world and others to thrive, no digital world or academic achievement can be a substitute for it.
