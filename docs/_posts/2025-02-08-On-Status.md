Status is the societal perception of your worth. It is a fundamentally extrinsic property. A teacher shaping young minds or a hospice nurse easing suffering may have profound personal fulfillment and social impact, yet command less status than a middling corporate executive.

The mechanics of status become clear in a simplified world: If the world only has two people, and both agree one’s work is more valuable, then that person has higher status. It has nothing to do with the substance of the work, just the subjective consensus of the group. Scaling this up, and status becomes the aggregate of what society deems valuable at a given time.

As a consequence, status is deeply cultural. The same trait can yield different status effects depending on the environment. Age commands respect because of the underlying wisdom and experiences they represent in Asian cultures, while in the West, youth and innovation often takes precedence, making a 25-year-old entrepreneur more revered than a seasoned veteran. Fair skin signals high status in Asia, tanned skin in the West. Obesity in women was admired as a sign of abundance in imperial China, when today thinness is associated with leisure and desirability in the same society. One can see how the traits of status change with the societal values at the given moment.

Yet beneath the shifting preferences lies the unchanging fact that status is born out of the necessity of survival. Throw some fish in a tank and watch them naturally establish pecking orders. Lion prides organize around dominant leaders. Early human tribes conferred status - and the influence that came with it - on those best equipped to secure the group’s survival.

Even today, higher status secures better outcomes for offspring. Despite cultural differences, fair skin in Asia and tanned skin in the West are both proxies for wealth. Body ideals follow the same logic. Though metrics may have evolved, society continues to confer status on those who:
- Possess rare skills and expertise
- Control wealth and resources
- Wield power and influence
- Are connected to other high status individuals
- Are physically attractive and carry themselves with confidence
- Are intelligent and insightful
- Embody unshakable integrity and moral conviction

Some say that, since survival is no longer our primary concern, we could build a society without status, one where everyone is equal. But this overlooks the fact that status isn't an artificial construct - it's a byproduct of being social creatures in a world where not everyone's the same. As long as people vary in ability, ambition, and preferences, certain traits will be valued over others. 

Just as status once ensured group survival, modern status hierarchies serve a practical utility: they reduce inefficiencies. In the corporate world, status is encoded in the org chart. The higher you are, the more status you have. Some companies have experimented with flat structures, believing they could eliminate hierarchy and create a workplace where everyone has equal ownership of business results. Instead, work became less efficient and more frustrating - people didn’t know who to consult for decisions, and informal status games emerged anyway as employees worked to establish influence and authority over decision making. 

A flat hierarchy can work only in small teams where status is implicitly understood and stored in everyone’s minds. But at scale, status hierarchies are essential to how humans cooperate.
