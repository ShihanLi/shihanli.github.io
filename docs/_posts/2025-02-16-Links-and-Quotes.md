### Quoting Gergely Orosz

> #### GenAI impact.
>
> We know first-hand that coding is an area in which Large Language Models are really helpful. Indeed, would it be so surprising if coding goes on to become the single best area of all that LLMs thrive in? The discipline looks tailor-made for it:
>
> - Programming languages are simpler than human languages
>
> - More high-quality training material is available for coding than for any other domain, in the form of well-written source code that's correct and works as expected. Much of this thanks to open source and GitHub!
>
> - Coding solves hallucinations – mostly. One of the biggest problems with LLMs is frequent hallucination. However, by using these for coding:
>   - Devs spot and fix hallucinations immediately, dismissing incorrect autocomplete suggestions
>   - Compiling code and running it against automated tests weeds out another big chunk of hallucination – and this step can also be automated.
>   - No other industry has workers immediately able to spot hallucinations, and automated tools to catch them. No wonder LLMs are being adopted faster by developers for day-to-day work than within any other industry.
>
> - AI tooling penetration is massive across developers: last year, about 75% of engineers said they use some AI coding tooling in our survey, [AI tooling for software engineers: reality check](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com).

### Quoting Scott Alexander

While I was reading Crime and Punishment, I was struck by how effortlessly the narrative seemed to unfold before me. The words flowed with a certain fluidity that pulled me deeper into the story without effort. In my search to understand how Dostoevsky accomplishes this, I landed on the below writing tip from Scott.

> If two sentences in a row start with the same word, it sounds unwieldy. If three or four do, it sounds bizarre. If it's a whole paragraph's worth, people start questioning their own sanity and trying to claw their eyes out.
>
> ...
>
> This is hard and really deserves a book-length treatment. Without the book, all I can say is to realize that any repetition of words and structures will stand out to your reader, and make sure that their standing-out emphasizes your point instead of just being confusing.
