I believe in being a humanist, which is an approach to life based on reason and our common humanity, recognizing that moral values are properly founded on human nature and experience alone.

It does not devoid me of religion and spiritiality. I believe in God, the Creator, and the objective, universal Truth. I believe that within every God's creation is inbued this Truth, and to find it is to look inward and appreciate the spiritiality with which we were created.

The great moral issue of today is the conflict between two different view points, the one of a static, traditional image of humanity, and the one of an evolving humanity, growing by following our instincts and by being a humanist. The first is restrictive, the second is freeing.

If everyone follows their own inner voice, that must necessarily leads to a subjective right and wrong, which conflicts with the concept of objective Truth? The fallacy here is one of logic. The universal Truth is objective and unchanged, and it can be reached through reason. if every human apply the same logical steps when reflecting inward, they should reach the same moral results. The differences stem from an inability to use logic whether that their ability to think is physically impaired, or that they willfully blind themselves to it due to external incentives, or that they go through life without trying to discover the Truth. The last two scenarios are indistinguishable in effect, and the people in those categories are immoral.
