This is an opinionated travel guide. Obviously not the only way to have a great day, but there's something about the activities selected and their order that brings magic to them. As a result, they make up my favorite travelling days and I'd recommend repeating them if you were to ever visit the same destination. 

1. Downtown Vancouver (April, bus only)
- Lynn canyon suspension bridge park
- Lunch at Shabusen Yakiniku House, alternatively somewhere closer to Main st
- Walk down main street
- Grab coffee at Foglifter
- Walk down the street next door (E 21st Ave), which has great cherry blossoms in April, would skip if otherwise
- Go to pottery workshop at 4Cats studios
- Peruse rare books at Carson's books and records
- Dinner at Tableau bar bistro


2. West Vancouver (August, need car)
- Late morning brunch
- Relax and read at Ambleside beach
- Drive down Marine dr and stop at whatever catches your eye
- Walk around lighthouse park
- Dinner at place of choosing
- Sea lion watching at horseshoe bay
- Sunset at Whytecliff Park
