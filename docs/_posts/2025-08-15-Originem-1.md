Over the last year, I've started to take learning French more seriously. Partially because it's a beautiful sounding language, partially because I've been living in Canada for a year and wanted to communicate with French speaking people around me.

I had taken a semester of French before in college, so I have a foundational level of vocabulary and some familiarity with the basic grammar. If I had to rate myself, I'm probably between A1 and A2 in the [CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) level.

Even though my goal this time is to get better at expressing myself and communicating in French, I still think vocabularies are important as they are the building block of sentences, and key to expressing myself accurately. So I started with an app called "[Reword: learn French](https://reword.app/en/fr)", which uses [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) to help your remember words with flashcards. 

Reword is well built and bug free. And after only a few months of practice, my reading comprehension had improved a great deal. However, the more words I reviewed, the more issues I started having with the app.

First, as my vocabulary grew, I started learning synonyms whose subtle differences in meaning were not captured in the flashcards. This made recalling difficult, as a definition could have equally mapped to either word.

Second, many of the flashcards were not "perfect" in that it lacks some form of data or context that I had to look up manually elsewhere to help me understand the words better. For example, I repeatedly looked up, or asked LLMs, roots of the words, example sentences that capture their different usage, cognates in English (words the share the same root), and sometimes memory hooks, all because the actual data included in the flashcards were not sufficient. I understand that it must be a lot of work for the developers to compile these contexts for each word accurately and comprehensively, but I ended up having to do this so many times that it became frustrating. 

Third, even though I was starting to understand written French a lot better, I still couldn't express myself well. The app doesn't help me practice outputing French in any way, which is a huge missed opportunity considering it knows which words I've learned and mastered, and could have easily built exercises on top of those words. This was the main reason I stopped using Reword, and after a while of not finding anything that helps me with French output, started looking to build it on my own.

I currently have a first prototype, and it's pretty rudimentary. I had found a Reddit post (mistake) for a list of French words scraped from the web, ranked by frequency. It made sense to me to learn the most frequent words first since they're the most impactful. For each word, I used AI to generate the metadata that I found helpful previously. I made a really simple spaced repetition algorithm that categorized each words into different states (new, learning, 1st review, ... 5th review, mastered), and hardcoded different review intervals for each state. Lastly, I added a mechanism that generate exercises based off of the words I've learned, the topic I want to practice, and the CEFR level I want to practice at.

I was aware of the latest development in the [FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/ABC-of-FSRS) at the time, but I figured I didn't care about that marginal improvement in efficiency the more advanced algorithm offered. I was wrong, and I only realized it after using the app a month. 

I named the prototype Originem, as the biggest feature was the inclusion of etymology. I found that this made the learning process much more pleasant. Check out the cards below, each of them gave me a "hmmm" moment when I learned about their unexpected cognates. It made me feel the connected and evolving nature of our languages. For someone who didn't have a "getting educated in that Latin school in Boston" experience, I now understand etymology's appeal.

Another thing I added was better stats tracking. Anything I could introduce that exposes how much progress I was making, helps keep me motivated to keep going.

The two biggest challenges I ran into are the word selection and the ineffectiveness of my rudimentary spaced repetition algorithm. 

I copied over around 7,000 words from a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/140xl68/resource_free_top_10000_french_words_listgrouped/), which unsurprisingly turned out to be not that great of a source. There are English words mixed in, which confused the AI to generate hallucinated responses for the supposed French words. There were tons of vulgar words, repeat words that makes the learning process slightly unpleasant. I had to do a LOT of manual cleaning and regenerating to make the flashcards satisfactory. I should have bought one of those frequency dictionaries that have curated sentences reflecting on best usage examples. They are definitely worth the money.  

The more impactful defect was that my algorithm was inefficient.

The 30 days mark was my arbitrary interval set for 5th review. Once I reviewed a word for the last time, I marked them as mastered. And it suddenly dawned on me that I will never see that them in my learning session again, which means I will for sure forget about some words later. This was really unacceptable, since the entire purpose of spaced repetition is to guarantee I can remember them forever. 

Another issue was that my learning sessions each day was getting longer and longer, to the point of taking 40 minutes each session. Since each word is not treated differently no matter how easily remembered some words are, I couldn't reduce the number of words to be reviewed daily since there's no way for the algorithm to know which words are more easily remembered and should be shown less frequently.

The last nail in the coffin was the rigidness of the exercise generation process. I would select a grammar topic, like "talking about the past with passe compose", and use AI to generate an exercise for it based off of the current CEFR level I selected, and a random selection of words I've learned. This really slowed down my session, but the effort was misdirected. I don't mind spending mental energy on learning how to express myself. I just don't want to be recalling the words at the same time when I'm focusing on learning the order or forms of words. So it's important for me to pick only the words at that given moment where I have the highest probability of recalling, which is only possible with a more advanced FSRS algorithm.

This is where I am now, working on imoproving the algorithm and the exercise generation experience. On the longer term, there's a voice in the back of my head that it's much better to learn languages like how children learn through interaction and immersion, instead of introducing all these mental effort in translations to the native language which act as inhibitors to expressing ourselves at the time of speaking. And that learning languages from a zero to one fashion is better than a one to N fashion. But that's for another time.

If you've read this far, I'd love to hear your thoughts on:
- How to best learn conjugations?
- Are there better ways to practice speaking in this app without having to translate English to French?
