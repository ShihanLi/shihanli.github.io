# Web Automation Agent System Specification

## Executive Summary

The Web Automation Agent System is a platform that empowers users to automate complex web-based tasks without programming knowledge. By combining a secure local data vault with intelligent automation agents, the system eliminates repetitive form-filling and navigation across websites. Users purchase task-specific agents from a marketplace, which then execute web workflows automatically using the user's securely stored personal data. This platform significantly reduces time spent on routine online tasks while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and security.

## Platform Value Proposition

### For Users
- **Time Savings**: Automate repetitive web tasks that typically require manual data entry and navigation
- **Data Security**: All sensitive information remains encrypted on the user's device
- **Simplified Complexity**: Complex web workflows reduced to single-click operations
- **Consistency**: Eliminate human error in form completion and submission
- **Privacy Protection**: No data sharing with third parties or cloud storage

### For Developers
- **Monetization**: Create and sell automation agents without maintaining backend infrastructure
- **Standardization**: Access to a structured data schema for consistent field definitions
- **Market Reach**: Connect with users seeking specific automation solutions
- **Reduced Support**: Standardized platform handles common technical issues

## What Is An Agent?

An agent is a specialized automation script that guides a web browser through a series of predefined steps to complete a specific online task. Unlike traditional bots or scripts, agents:

1. **Are Non-Executable**: Contain only task descriptions and selectors, not executable code
2. **Are Data-Aware**: Define exactly which user data fields they require
3. **Are Interactive**: Can pause for user verification at critical steps
4. **Are Browser-Based**: Operate within a visible browser instance for transparency
5. **Are Task-Specific**: Each agent is designed for a particular workflow (e.g., "Apply for a tourist visa to Japan")

Agents act as virtual assistants that navigate websites, fill forms, and handle routine interactions while keeping the user in control of the final submission or verification steps.

## Core System Components

### 1. Desktop Application

- Cross-platform application supporting Windows and macOS
- Provides interface for users to interact with agents, manage vault data, and browse the agent marketplace
- Embeds browser functionality using Playwright and "browser use" open source project

### 2. Secure Vault

- Local storage for sensitive personal information and documents
- Supports file formats: PDF, PNG, JPEG, TXT, CSV, JSON
- Implements AES-CBC 256-bit encryption with PBKDF2 SHA-256 key derivation
- Standardized data schema for consistent information retrieval
- Interface similar to "paperless" for document uploads, plus key-value pair input

### 3. Agent Marketplace

- Allows developers to publish and monetize web automation agents for various tasks
- One-time purchase model implemented through Stripe
- Search functionality by keywords
- Filter options by category and popularity (ratings + purchase count)
- Agent listings include detailed descriptions, demonstration videos, download counts, and ratings

### 4. Agent Structure

- Text-based specification of browser automation tasks for any web-based workflow
- List of data fields required from the vault
- No actual code execution (task descriptions only)
- Distinction between local fields and central registry fields

## User Workflow

1. User accesses agent catalog and selects an agent for their desired web task
2. System compares required data fields against user's vault
3. If data is missing, user is prompted to supply the information
4. User initiates agent by clicking "run"
5. Agent proceeds through web automation steps with visual progress indication:
   - Shows steps
   - Displays progress bar
   - Shows the actual browser window
6. Agent prompts user when additional information is needed
7. Agent handles authentication with stored credentials once user verifies email
8. At completion, agent stops at the predefined checkpoint for user review
9. User manually completes the final action after verification
10. System does not track status after the agent completes its task

## Data Management

### Central Field Registry

- Standardized data schema for common web form fields across various domains
- Namespace structure for field organization (e.g., address.current.street, payment.card.number)
- Field definitions include data type, validation rules, descriptions, examples
- Process for developers to submit new field definitions

### Field Definition Process

1. Search registry for existing similar fields
2. Define custom field with proper namespace
3. Submit field definition with justification
4. Implement locally while awaiting approval
5. Update to reference official registry once approved

### Common Field Domains (Examples)

- Personal identification (name, DOB, government IDs)
- Contact information (email, phone, address)
- Payment details (credit cards, bank accounts)
- Professional information (employment, education)
- Travel documents (passport, visa history)
- Health information (insurance, medical history)
- Account credentials (usernames, security questions)
- Preferences and settings (language, notifications)

## Technical Specifications

### Security

- AES-CBC 256-bit encryption for vault data
- PBKDF2 SHA-256 for encryption key derivation
- Local storage of sensitive information (never leaves device)
- Credential storage for automated login to websites

### Agent Execution

- Browser automation via Playwright
- Ability to resume from previous step if interrupted
- Handles login credentials and security questions
- Compares final state against expected success result for verification

### Agent Quality Control

- Video proof requirement for dispute resolution if abuse detected
- Flagging system for agents that stop working due to website changes
- Developer update process for fixing broken agents

### Agent Categories (Examples)

- Shopping and e-commerce automation

- Travel booking and management
- Government applications and services
- Financial services and banking
- Healthcare portals and scheduling
- Education and enrollment systems
